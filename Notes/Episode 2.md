npm is not node package manager. It's a package manager however. 
All the utilities, packages that we need are hosted on npm. It's a huge repo.

npm init - generates package.json which is a configuration for npm.
Most important dependency is bundler(for shipping to prod) - webpack, parcel, veet
React app uses webpack.

npm install -D parcel
-D tells that we need parcel in dev env only because bundling will be done before prod.


  "parcel": "^2.12.0" ^(safe to use) is for minor updates installing automatically
  ~ is for installing major version automatically.

package.json keeps a track of approx version(is a configuration).
package-lock.json keeps a track of the exact version of dependencies.
These 2 needs to pushed to git. Node modules can be generated by these 2 files.
